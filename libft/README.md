# 📚 Libft

The first project of 42 ! Here we learn how to create a library in C.
There is nothing to say about this project... we need to reacreate some function from the `standart lib c`. 
We learn how to protect our function against segfault and how to use malloc, protect them and free them.

The project was interesting but not very creative or fun... Use the man to learn how the function work and re-create it. If you struggle, ask help to other students and if you can't earch on the net !
