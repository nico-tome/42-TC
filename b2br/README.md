# Born to be Root (B2BR)

## 📑 Overview

**Born to be Root** is a system administration project from the 42 School curriculum that focuses on setting up and configuring a virtual machine with strict security requirements. This project introduces students to Linux system administration, virtualization, and best practices for securing a production-like environment.

## ✔️ Project Objective

The primary goal of Born to be Root is to create a secured, functional virtual machine following a specific set of rules and regulations. Students must demonstrate their understanding of system configuration, user management, and security hardening.

## 🔑 Key Concepts & Topics Covered

### 1. **Virtualization & System Setup**
- Virtual machine installation and configuration
- Partition management and disk organization
- Boot loader configuration (GRUB)
- File system types and management

### 2. **Linux Operating System Basics**
- Operating system selection and installation
- System initialization and runlevels
- Service management and systemd
- Process management

### 3. **User & Group Management**
- Creating and managing user accounts
- Group creation and user assignment
- Sudo configuration and privileges
- User authentication and access control

### 4. **Security Hardening**
- SSH server configuration and security
- Password policies (complexity, expiration, history)
- Firewall setup (UFW - Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Port management and network security
- SELinux or AppArmor implementation (OS-dependent)

### 5. **System Monitoring & Logging**
- System resource monitoring tools
- Log file management
- Cron job scheduling
- System audit and intrusion detection concepts

### 6. **Network Configuration**
- Hostname and DNS configuration
- Network interface setup
- Static IP assignment
- Network connectivity and troubleshooting

### 7. **Package Management**
- Package installation and updates using apt/dnf/pacman
- Dependency management
- System package maintenance
- Security updates

### 8. **Scripts & Automation**
- Writing shell scripts for system tasks
- Cron jobs for automated tasks
- System monitoring scripts
- Bash scripting fundamentals

### 9. **Compliance & Standards**
- Following the 42 project requirements
- Rule-based configuration
- Documentation and best practices
- Configuration verification

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Requirements (Typical)

- **VM Specifications**
  - Minimum 2 CPUs (4 recommended)
  - Minimum 4GB RAM
  - Minimum 30GB disk space
  - Network adapter configuration

- **Operating System**
  - Debian-based or Red Hat-based Linux distribution
  - Specific kernel version requirements may apply
  - Lightweight desktop environment (optional)

- **Mandatory Services**
  - SSH server with specific security settings
  - Web server (typically Apache or Nginx)
  - Database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB)
  - Firewall with specific rules

## 🧠 Key Learning Outcomes
