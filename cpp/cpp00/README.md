# CPP 00

Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuf.

## 📣 | ex 00

The idea was to learn namespaces, functions and stdio streams in c++. The exercice ask me to take a user input and print it with every letter in uppercase.
So after quick research I found that the library `cstring` offer me some interersting functions like `strlen` for looping in the string and `toupper` for changing the letter into the uppercase version.
I also used `iostream` with `cout`.

This exercice introduce me to classes, initialization, static, const etc... The goal was to create a Phone Book to store some contacts with theire names, nicknames, phone numbers and secrets.
To do this I used the same libraries with `cstring` and `iostream` for input reading and ouput, but I also used some mores. The I was introduce to classes, theire declaration and destructor.
After understanding the concept of public and private functions and variable the rest of the project was very simple, with adding and reading infos from an array of contacts.

## 🏗️ | ex 02

The last execice ask me to recreate a `.cpp` file from a `.log` and `.hpp` files. So after reading carefully the header and understanding what functions want to do by theire name and return type, 
I look at the log file and found every sentence I need to output. After that we just need logic and use what we learn from the 2 last exercices to complete this one.
